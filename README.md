Chosen Computation: Based off of Problem 23 on projecteuler.net, our program will take in a positive integer as the input. We will perform computations to see if the given integer is "perfect", "abundant", or "deficient". This property can be determined by finding the factors of the integer, and then checking if the sum of those factors is equal to, greater than, or less than the original integer.
